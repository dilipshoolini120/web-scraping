# web-scraping
Question. What is web-scraping?
Answer. According to wikipedia, Web scraping, is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. It is a form of copying, in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis. Web scraping happens in two parts - first is Fetching and the second is Extracting.
When a page is downloaded it is known as Fetching and this is what a browser does. Web-crawling is the main component of Web-scraping, to fetch web pages for later processing. Once Fetching is done, then the second part starts which is called Extracting.
Extracting is anything the person doing it takes from the fetched pages. 
After this much is done, the people keep this extracted data for other purposes.
An example for this could be an archivists taking information from files and storing it on their computers. Though web-scraping is almost the opposite of that. Taking data from the web and keeping it for later use.
