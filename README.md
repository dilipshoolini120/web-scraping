1. What is web-scrapping?
Ans. According to wikipedia, Web scraping, is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. It is a form of copying, in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis. Web scraping happens in two parts - first is Fetching and the second is Extracting.
When a page is downloaded it is known as Fetching and this is what a browser does. Web-crawling is the main component of Web-scraping, to fetch web pages for later processing. Once Fetching is done then, the second part starts -Extracting.
